## How to install and run the application

In order to run the application:
- clone this Git repo
- run `npm i` both in the `backend` and `frontend` directories
- after npm finises installing the modules run  `npm run dev`  both in `backend` and `frontend`
- you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000/`
  
The default configuration assumes MongoDb runs locally. In case you want to use MongoDb Atlas be sure to update the `DB_CONNECTION_STRING` in the `backend/.env` file.


## Notes
- the app uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication
- `express-mongo-sanitize` and `DOMPurify` are used for input sanitization
